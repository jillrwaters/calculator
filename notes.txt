FUNCTIONS:

*math: [add, subtract, multiply, divide, roundTwoDecimals, isInt, operate]

-operate:
    -PURPOSE: perform whatever operation according to the data that has been stored so far and show it on the screen
    -LOGIC:
        - if operation has already executed?
        - use relevant math function on 2 parameters
    -VARIABLES:
        - operands
        - operator(s)
        - ?
        - updateDisplay
    TRIGGER: when equals sign is pressed?
    RETURN: show result on screen
------------------------------------------------
*change screen info: [inputNum, updateDisplay, clearEverything]
-----------
-inputNum:
    -PURPOSE: show numbers on the screen as they are being pressed, up to 11 digits
    -LOGIC: 
        - if the screen says zero, replace with last digit pressed
        - if screen is not zero AND there are less than 11 digits on the screen, append digit
    -VARIABLES:
        - display value

    -TRIGGER: when any number key is pressed
    -RETURN: ?
-----------
updateDisplay: 
    -PURPOSE: change display to new value
    -LOGIC:
        - whatever is entered as the parameter will be displayed on the screen
    -VARIABLES:
        - ?
    -TRIGGER:
        - when called inside a function
    -RETURN: new display value?
-----------
clearEverything:
    -PURPOSE: clear all relevant variables
    -LOGIC: ?
    -VARIABLES: 
        - display value
        - all operators and operands
    -TRIGGER: when 'CE' button is pressed
    -RETURN: none
--------------------------------------------------
*store info: [newOpd, newOpt]
-----------
- newOpd:
    -PURPOSE: stores new operand to a variable, depending on logic
    -LOGIC: 
        - variable operand is stored to depends on operands that are already stored or not. assign to next available operand.
        - if equals sign has already been pressed and screen not cleared? or operate function has already run. 
    -VARIABLES:
            - answer? - the last answer that was stored as a result of running operate()
            - opdA - fill if empty | move on if not
            - opdB - fill if empty
            - storedOperands? - list of stored operands 
    -TRIGGER: ?
    -RETURN: ? just store the operand ?
-----------
- newOpt:
    -PURPOSE: stores new operator to variable depending on logic
    -LOGIC: variable it is stored to depends on what has already been stored.
        - has the equals sign already been pressed?? or operate() already been run?
            - if operate already ran?
            - if not?
        - variables:
            - optA - fill if empty | move on if not
            - optB - fill if empty
    -TRIGGER: when any operator is pressed
----------------
expression(?) - takes multiple parameters and performs calculations based on parameters. pass 2 at a time into operate()????
